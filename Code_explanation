1. The structure of Co-Forest.ipynb
Initialization -- This part of the code initializes the spark session and split the data

The implementation of Co-Forest algorithm -- This part of code is the implementation of Co-Forest algorithm, the main steps of the algorithm are written into buildClassifier method.

Test -- This part of the code test our model on the test data set

Evaluation -- This part of the code evaluates the performance of the model on the test data set

Stop -- This part of the code stop the spark session

How to use this code: simply run all cells in sequence.
How to use the different datasets in the code: simply modify the path variable in the cell under the "Initialization" caption.
How to change the configuration of the algorithm: In the cell under "The implementation of Co-Forest algorithm", there are comments in the code. These comments mark the place where you can change the configurations of the algorithm


2. The structure of Tri-Training.ipynb


The implementation of Tri-training algorithm -- This part of the code is the implementation of Tri-training algorithm. 

Initialization -- This part of the code initializes the spark session and split the data

Train -- This part of the code initializes and train our model

Test  -- This part of the code tests our model on the test data set

Evaluate-- This part of the code evaluates the performance of the model on the test data set

Stop -- This part of the code stops the spark session

How to use this code: simply run all cells in sequence.
How to use different datasets in the code: simply modify the path variable in the cell under the "Initialization" caption.
How to change the configuration of the algorithm: modify the label_ratio, unlabel_ratio, and test_ratio in the initialization part or modify the numTrees, maxDepth in the Train part.
